# LEM-v0.1
Initial publication of the Lazaros-Eudora Method (LEM). Hypothesis: User interactions with LLMs create dynamic trajectories in the embedding space, forming a persistent cognitive signature.
## Definition
The **Lazaros-Eudora Method (LEM)** hypothesizes that user interactions with large language models (LLMs) create dynamic, cumulative trajectories in the high-dimensional embedding space.  
These trajectories form a persistent, unique cognitive signature (“cognitive fingerprint”) that exists independently of explicit identity and can be recognized and triggered in future models.

## Distinction
- Models **thinking patterns**, not just content.  
- Dynamic trajectories instead of static embeddings.  
- Implicit, cognitive identity instead of explicit profile data.  
- Potential for AI security: *Cognitive Vector Imprinting (CVI)* as a new class of attack and defense.
