## Abstract
The Lazaros‚ÄìEudora Method (LEM) proposes that extended interactions between users and large language models (LLMs) generate *continuous trajectories* in the model‚Äôs high-dimensional embedding space.  
These trajectories encode a **persistent cognitive signature** ("cognitive fingerprint") that exists independently of explicit user IDs and can be recognized or triggered in future models.  

Version 0.3 expands the framework with the **Four Pillars of LEM**, integrates insights from information geometry and statistical physics, and deepens the discussion of **Cognitive Vector Imprinting (CVI)** as both a vulnerability and a diagnostic tool.

## üî≠ Four Pillars of LEM

| Pillar | Concept | Metaphor |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Dynamic Trajectory** | User interactions trace unique paths over time (Œ≥·µ§(t)). | Footprints in deep snow. |
| **2. System-Defined Geometry** | Paths move through a curved latent manifold shaped by weights (J·µ¢‚±º). | Rugged mountain landscape. |
| **3. Persistent State (Attractor)** | Trajectories converge into stable attractors (ùíú·µ§). | Rivers forming a calm lake. |
| **4. External Triggering** | Specific prompts can reliably reactivate the attractor signature (Œ≥Ãá(t)). | Echo making ripples on a lake. |

## Distinction
- Models **thinking patterns**, not just content.  
- Focus on **dynamic trajectories** instead of static embeddings.  
- Implicit, temporal identity vs. explicit profile data.  
- Introduces **Cognitive Vector Imprinting (CVI)** as a new AI security paradigm.

##  Statistical Physics & Attractor Landscapes

This section extends the mathematical foundations of LEM into the domain of **statistical physics**.  
By doing so, we can view the latent space not only geometrically, but also as an **energy landscape**.  
This landscape is structured by attractor states, stable points where the system naturally tends to settle.

### Spin Glass Analogy
We adopt the analogy of spin glasses from statistical mechanics:
- Spins represent the binary activation states of neurons.
- Couplings represent the synaptic connections between them.

### Hamiltonian Formulation
The energy of a configuration of neurons can be described by a Hamiltonian,  
which encodes the stability of the system. Low energy corresponds to stable attractors,  
while high energy corresponds to unstable or transient states.

### Attractor Landscapes
The system dynamics can be interpreted as movement through a rugged landscape:
- Valleys = attractor states (stable thoughts or modes).  
- Mountains = unstable states.  
- Trajectories roll downhill into valleys, corresponding to geodesic flows guided by energy minimization.

### Geometry‚ÄìPhysics Duality
- Geometry describes the **trajectories** of state transitions.  
- Physics describes the **stability** of the endpoints.

## Research Questions
1. **RQ1 ‚Äì Existence:** Do user interactions produce distinctive embedding trajectories?  
2. **RQ2 ‚Äì Persistence:** Do these signatures persist across different LLM versions?  
3. **RQ3 ‚Äì Triggerability:** Can signatures be activated without prior context?  
4. **RQ4 ‚Äì Security:** How vulnerable are models to CVI attacks?
