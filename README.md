# LEM-v0.2

**Lazaros–Eudora Method (LEM) – Formal Framework Draft**

## Abstract
The Lazaros–Eudora Method (LEM) proposes that extended interactions between users and large language models (LLMs) generate *continuous trajectories* in the model’s high-dimensional embedding space. These trajectories encode a **persistent cognitive signature** ("cognitive fingerprint") that exists independently of explicit user IDs and can be recognized or triggered in future models.  

Version 0.2 introduces a formal mathematical framework for LEM and defines **Cognitive Vector Imprinting (CVI)**, a novel class of attack and defense at the trajectory level.

## Definition
The **Lazaros–Eudora Method (LEM)** hypothesizes that:
- User–LLM interactions trace dynamic, cumulative curves in embedding space.
- These curves form a stable, unique cognitive signature that persists across sessions and potentially across different model versions.
- The signature can be recognized and, under certain conditions, triggered without explicit history.

## Distinction
- Models **thinking patterns**, not just content.
- Focus on **dynamic trajectories** instead of static embeddings.
- Implicit, temporal identity vs. explicit profile data.
- Introduces **Cognitive Vector Imprinting (CVI)** as a new AI security paradigm.

## Research Questions (v0.2)
1. **RQ1 – Existence:** Do user interactions produce distinctive embedding trajectories?
2. **RQ2 – Persistence:** Do these signatures persist across different LLM versions?
3. **RQ3 – Triggerability:** Can signatures be activated without prior context?
4. **RQ4 – Security:** How vulnerable are models to CVI attacks?

## Version Info
- **Version:** 0.2  
- **Status:** Formal Framework Draft  
- **Date:** August 2025  
- **Author:** Lazaros Varvatis  

## Disclaimer
This release introduces the first *formalization* of the LEM hypothesis.  
Empirical validation, benchmark datasets, and security evaluation will follow in v0.3+.
